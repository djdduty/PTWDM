# Potential Talk Subjects

This is a collection of talk ideas from things that I deal with on a daily basis or otherwise have researched / played with enough to try and share knowledge.

### Guide
"Large Topics" are topics which have the potential to be very lengthy talks or too large a scope to deal with in one session

### Subjects
* Docker (Containerized deployments), large topic
* Micro Service Architecture, medium topic
* Firebase (and other serverless design), medium topic
* Offline first javascript clients (and the synchronization of data), large topic
* Static file management (cache busting, CDN deployment), small topic
* The deprecation of jquery (Using es6 with babel / babili in a backwards compatible way), small topic
* Vue.js / React.js primer, could be a large topic
* Websockets, could be a medium topic; likely a small one
* Mobile first development & responsive design, small-medium topic
